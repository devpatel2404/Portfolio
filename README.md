# Welcome to the Repository of my Portfolio

If you want to see the app visit <a href="https://devspatelportfolio.netlify.app" target="_blank">here</a>

I’ll be making regular updates as I complete new projects or make improvements to my portfolio.

Built with Next.js and currently hosted on Netlify, this portfolio reflects my commitment to both functionality and design.
Originally conceived as a minimalist, one-page layout, the portfolio has evolved over time.
I wanted to create a user-friendly experience that allows visitors to easily scroll through the content while still maintaining a clean, professional look, and showcasing my skills.
While focusing on a sleek design, I've also incorporated a bit of my personality and humor to make it uniquely mine.

What you'll find in my portfolio:
<ul>
<li><b>Home Page</b> – A welcoming introduction and overview, offering a quick glance at who I am and what I do, with intuitive navigation to guide you through the rest of the site.</li>

<li><b>About Page</b> – A deeper dive into my background, development journey, and what motivates me as a creator. I share insights into my personality, work ethic, and what I bring to every project.</li>

<li><b>Tech Page</b> – A look at the tools and setup I use daily — from my MacBook and mechanical keyboard to the software and operating systems I rely on. It's a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the environment that helps me stay productive and inspired.</li>

</ul>

If you have any questions or would like to connect, feel free to contact me via email or any of my listed contact methods. I'm always open to new opportunities and conversations.

Let me know if you'd like to adjust anything!
